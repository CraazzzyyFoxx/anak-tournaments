 * A user's statistics share the §4.3 shape `["user-stats", userId, axis, discipline, family, ...filters]`, so a
 * catalog sync of one game drops them by the discipline position (`invalidateCatalogSync`). The index families are
 * `[family, axis, discipline, ...filters]` (§2.6).

 * No user id in the `me` keys: the server resolves the account from the token,
 * and a per-user key would imply the cache could legitimately hold another
 * account's profile. They are cleared with the rest of the authenticated cache
 * on sign-out.
