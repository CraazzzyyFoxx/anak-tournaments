"""The caller's own subscription standing, plus redemption rate limiting.

Feeds the registration form: one call returns the composed outcome, a
human-readable rule, and a per-provider verdict so the form can render a chip on
each account row and a summary line above them. Without the summary line an
``any`` requirement reads as two independent failures.

It also answers whether the registration gate would refuse this patron right now,
computed by the same composition the gate itself runs — the form must be able to
say "you cannot sign up yet" up front rather than let three steps be filled in
and answer 400 at submit.

Never forces a provider refresh -- the form polls this on render. Only the gates
force a fresh look, and only for the one acting user.
