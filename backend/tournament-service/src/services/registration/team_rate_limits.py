"""Per-actor rate limits for the public team-registration flows (§7 control 1).

These are the only *authenticated* rate limits in the stack. The gateway's
``internal/ratelimit`` is per-IP, per-process and scoped to ``/api/auth/*``; nginx
provides a coarse outer layer. Neither bounds what one logged-in account can do,
which is exactly the surface the captain and invitee flows open.

**The fail direction is deliberately not uniform, and that is the whole design
decision here.**

* ``invite`` **fails closed.** Each call mints a bearer credential — a token whose
  holder can write a registration into someone else's roster — and (once step 6
  lands) sends a notification. That makes it an amplifier, so losing Redis must not
  turn it into an unmetered one. The cost is real and accepted: during a Redis
  outage captains cannot invite.

* ``accept``/``decline`` **fail open**, matching
  :func:`assert_redeem_attempt_allowed` for challenge codes. The thing a limiter
  protects there is a 256-bit token against guessing, which is already infeasible;
  the limiter is defence in depth. Blocking legitimate invitees during a Redis blip
  is the worse outcome, and — unlike invite — a *successful* accept is
  self-limiting: one registration per player per tournament means the second one
  cannot succeed at all.

Uniform fail-closed was the original note in the design; splitting it is a
correction, not a shortcut. Applying invite's reasoning to accept would trade a
real availability loss for protection against an attack that 256 bits of entropy
already prevents.
