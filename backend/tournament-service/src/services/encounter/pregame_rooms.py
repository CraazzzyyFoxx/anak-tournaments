"""The organizer's tournament-wide list of pre-game rooms.

Answers "which room needs me right now" for a whole tournament: one row per
encounter that plays a pick-ban room, carrying the phase it sits in, the open
step of each kind and the handful of attention flags staff act on (a dispute,
an expired timer, a match that started with a captain still not ready).

STRICTLY read-only, and so is the room's own read now
(``pick_ban_action.get_pick_ban_state``) -- but this one has a second reason to
be: it answers a whole tournament at once. Nothing here calls
``ensure_pick_ban_session``, ``get_pick_ban_state`` or ``_settle``, nothing
commits, nothing emits and nothing asks the healer for a pass. What it does
instead is read the same rows in BULK (a constant number of queries, never one
per encounter) and feed them to the very same pure functions the room uses:
``pick_ban_rules.current_step``/``step_progress`` for the cursor,
``pick_ban_config.pick_config`` for the config cascade,
``unavailable_reason_for`` for a room that cannot open, and
``PickBanActionService.step_deadline`` for the timer.

Phase/attention ranking lives in the two pure functions at the bottom, where it
can be exercised without a database.
