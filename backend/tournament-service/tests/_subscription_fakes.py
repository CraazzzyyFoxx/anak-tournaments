"""Shared stand-in for ``SubscriptionResolver.load_requirement``.

Four suites -- the check-in gate, the registration gate, the participants list and the
patron's own status read -- each need a fake resolver that turns a raw rule blob into
what the real resolver would hand back. Every one of them used to carry its own copy of
that parse-and-fail-open logic, which meant the contract was defined FIVE times: once
in ``shared.services.subscriptions.entitlements.SubscriptionResolver.load_requirement``
and once per suite. All four suites would therefore have stayed green if the real
contract regressed, which is exactly backwards for a chokepoint the whole admission
stack trusts.

One definition, imported everywhere. It must keep tracking the real
``load_requirement``: same caught exception set (see ``resolver_rule`` below), same
empty-collapse. The behaviour itself is unit-tested against the real resolver in
``shared/tests/test_subscription_load_requirement.py``; this module exists so the gate
suites can stay focused on their own decision tables rather than re-testing the parse.

Only the helper is shared. The fake resolvers stay in their own suites: each gate asks
the resolver different questions, and merging them would trade four honest fakes for
one that has to be configured into four shapes.
