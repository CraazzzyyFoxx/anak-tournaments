"""One evaluation, two surfaces, identical answer.

The property under test is the one the five deleted client-side copies violated:
the public participants read and the admin registrations read of the SAME
registration must carry a byte-identical ``admission`` object. Before this layer
they carried five raw fields and each surface re-derived the verdict from them,
two of the five derivations deliberately disagreeing with the other three.

Also pins the two things ``AdmissionChips`` exists to get right:

- the chip fields (``profiles_open`` / ``subscription_outcome`` /
  ``subscription_verdicts``) are lifted OUT of the evaluation rather than resolved
  a second time -- a second resolution is precisely how the admin column and the
  player's own card came to disagree;
- a requirement this tournament switched off leaves those chips ``None``, not
  ``{}``. That is the value they have carried all along for a tournament that does
  not require the thing, and an empty dict would make the client render an empty
  Subscription column instead of no column.

No database: the evaluation is produced by the real ``evaluate`` over stub
signals, and the registration is a stub carrying only what the serializers read.
