"""Typed-RPC subjects of the rank domain: ``rpc.stats.rank.*``, for every game that collects ranks.

``?discipline=`` names the game (default Overwatch, the first collector); each subject dispatches to that module's
``DisciplineSpec.collection_handlers`` entry, which validates its payload and authorizes the caller. Reads are public
(AuthNone); the admin operations need the caller's identity. A game whose module serves no such handler is a 404.
