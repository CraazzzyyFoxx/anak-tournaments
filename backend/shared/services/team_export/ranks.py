"""Rank-only re-export: push fresh ranks onto already-materialized players.

The full export (:mod:`shared.services.team_export.service`) is destructive — it
deletes the prior ``Team``/``Player`` rows and recreates them, which is exactly
what must NOT happen once a bracket references those teams. When only the numbers
went stale (a rank fixed in the balancer after the export, a draft pick frozen
before the registration had a rank), this updates ``Player.rank`` in place and
touches nothing else.

Rows are matched by ``Player.name`` within the tournament: ``materialize_teams``
wrote that column verbatim from the same payload member, so no identity
re-resolution is needed and a name the export never created simply matches nothing.
