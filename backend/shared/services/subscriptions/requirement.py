"""Compose per-provider subscription verdicts into one admission answer.

A tournament may require a subscription on one provider, on ALL of several, or on
ANY ONE of several, each with its own ``min_tier_rank`` (Boosty "Уровень 2" and
Twitch "Tier 2" are unrelated scales).

Composition uses **Kleene three-valued logic**, NOT boolean logic with ``unknown``
coerced to a side. Coercing ``unknown`` to false would make ``any[refused,
unknown]`` block, so one provider's outage would lock out every patron subscribed
via the other. Coercing it to true would make ``all[refused, unknown]`` pass,
admitting a confirmed non-subscriber. Kleene is the only mapping that preserves
"block only on certainty" in both modes.

The gate blocks IFF the composed outcome is ``REFUSED``. ``deferred_providers``
exists for the one gate that runs *before* the patron has been offered every
proof path — see ``evaluate_requirement``.
