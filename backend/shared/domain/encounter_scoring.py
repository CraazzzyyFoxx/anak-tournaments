"""One scoring engine for every encounter: a duel series and an FFA lobby alike.

Three questions, all answered by the organizer's own formulas over N teams
(docs/plans/2026-10-12-multi-game-architecture.md §5):

* what one game pays a team -- ``game_formula`` over the rule's columns plus
  ``place``, ``place_pts``, ``teams`` and ``win``;
* whether the encounter is over -- ``end_formula`` over ``best_of``, ``games``
  and ``max_wins``, asked after every confirmed game;
* whether a captain's claim about an unconfirmed series can be true at all --
  :func:`series_claim_errors`.

Pure: no session, no ORM rows, no ``eval``. The result writer validates with it,
the standings rank with it and the lobby read renders with it, so the table a
viewer sees and the rows advancement reads are the same arithmetic by
construction. A series is not a special case here: "one point per map won" is
the ``wins`` preset's game formula, nothing more.
