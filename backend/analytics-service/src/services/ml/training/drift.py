"""Feature-distribution drift monitoring.

For each numeric feature column in the training frame, compare the last 3
tournaments' distribution against the rest of the training set using
:func:`scipy.stats.wasserstein_distance`, **normalised by the baseline's own
scale**. Distances larger than ``threshold`` are flagged via the returned report
(the APScheduler hook in :mod:`src.scheduler` forwards flagged drifts to Sentry).

The normalisation matters: raw Wasserstein distance is expressed in the feature's
own units, so a fixed threshold is meaningless across features measured in SR
(thousands), damage (tens of thousands), and win rate (0..1). With the raw
distance every wide-range feature clears 0.25 permanently — the nightly job
reported "50 features above threshold" for all 50 features it measured, every
night, which is noise rather than a signal. Dividing by the baseline standard
deviation makes the score dimensionless ("shifted by a quarter of a standard
deviation") and comparable across features.
