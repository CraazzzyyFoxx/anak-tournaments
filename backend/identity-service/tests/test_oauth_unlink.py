"""Self-service OAuth unlink guard (``oauth.unlink``).

The account UI renders its unlink button from ``social_account.is_verified``,
while the guard counts ``auth.oauth_connections`` — two tables nothing keeps in
sync (an admin profile merge moves verified rows between players and leaves the
connections behind). These cover the resulting states.

The three collaborators the flow reads through (OAuth connections, player
lookup, social marks) are injected as stubs, so each test states the DB shape it
is about in one line instead of scripting a sequence of ``session.execute``
results.
